# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I planned out my game a little more by white boarding the HTML page and understading what elements I need.
2. Draft the index.html page, and begin styling content
3. I need to really lean in and define the game logic. That is not coming easy right now because I don't think I'm making asking the right specific questions. ONce I find those, I can code what I need.

Here's images of the white board, drawing out what I want to show.

- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. Set up and erased everything. Trying ti understand what exactly I want to make.
2. Just to get something started.
3. I can't seem to get a functioning template started here; as if, I'm not really sure how I want this game to be portrayed. Continuing to work things out...

# Tuesday

- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. Set up the html, added a few lines to CSS, and worked out the initial JS logic for clicking and matching cards. Very basic. Click two cards and get a match (if the class is the same), otherwise get a false.
2. I just want to finsh this things and get some working functionality here.
3. Having some trouble thinking through this things, and coming up with the game engine. Almost there. I hope.

# Final Day 
1 What HTML, CSS, and or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?
I learned more about flexbox than I thought I would. That's a great thing and I'm really thankful about it. As far as JavaScript, I did learn a ton about how to structure a .js file, essentially, and this is coming from a literature major, how to make the page more readable for people. Literate programming.



2 What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?
I am going to work through more JavaScript functions. I really need to work through more problems in this area.
