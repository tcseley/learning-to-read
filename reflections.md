1. I planned out my game a little more by white boarding the HTML page and understading what elements I need.
2. Draft the index.html page, and begin styling content
3. I need to really lean in and define the game logic. That is not coming easy right now because I don't think I'm making asking the right specific questions. ONce I find those, I can code what I need.

Here's images of the white board, drawing out what I want to show.
