# Proposal of Game
  
  I am going to create a memory game by having the player match identical cards in a card grid. The player will select one card, see the picture, and select another card to find a match.

  I want to have two skill levels. The first is Easy mode. Nothing fancy here, just match the cards to get points; acter all the cards are matched, the player wins. The points and the time elapsed from starting the gaem will be displayed. The player can then repeat the game and try to beat their time.

  The hard mode will have more cards in the grid, and I think I'd like the theme to change, too. Instead of matching identical cards, the player will have to match identical themes. For instance, if Marvel characters are used as the card images, in Hard mode the player will have to match "X-men" and find, say, Wolverine and Rouge, not just the same picture of Wolverine.

  I'll have a congrats! message that appears once the game is won, and the overall time will be displayed. The player can then try again and attempt to beat the time.

  A Restart button will be added to reset the game, of course.

  I'd like to add an API for the card images, and have a card shuffle function on replay.
