# Memory Game

This memory game uses a match the card concept to play. The player selects a card, and tries to find the matching pair. Unmatched cards are flipped back over, and matched cards stay visible to the end of the game.

# HOW TO PLAY

The game is easy to begin playing immediately. Click on a card and see the symbol underneath. Try and find the identical symbol on another card. Once all the cards are matched, the game will reset and the cards will be shuffled.
